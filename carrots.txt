This is a very incomplete list of potential rewards/incentives. It is deliberately
not simply a list of "prizes" but largely includes monetary components; how these
would be funded is something the CB would need to think about in due course if
any of this takes off. I just note that in the general context of LHCb expenditure, the
sums mentioned amount to a few thousand CHF, i.e. peanuts. Frankly we could take this
money out of the M&O which is normally spent on the farm, since we know that improving
our software has already saved hundreds of thousands of CHF in servers.

The funding to attend non-HEP meetings or conferences is also very deliberate, because
physicists don't have enough opportunities to engage with software professionals. It is
good both for the physicist's ability to transfer to industry if they so choose, and good
for bringing advanced coding methods back to our collaboration.

I am of course aware that all the prizes in the world won't make up for how software skills
get valued by job selection committees, and I am not pretending having these prizes will 
automagically make everything better, but we have to start somewhere.

1) An annual thesis prize for "most innovative contribution to LHCb software by a PhD student",
a reward of 500 CHF plus funding for one trip to a non-HEP conference/hackathon/whatever
of the winner's choice. To be awarded by the computing project management, open nominations.

2) An annual prize for contributions to LHCb software, a reward of 1000 CHF plus
funding for one trip to a non-HEP conference/hackathon/whatever of the winner's choice.
To be awarded by the computing project management, open nominations.

3) A prize for any code improvement which speeds up the reconstruction or trigger configuration
by 5% or more, a reward of 1000 CHF plus funding for one trip to a non-HEP
conference/hackathon/whatever of the winner's choice. To be awarded by the computing project
management, open nominations.

4) A prize for collaborative programming, for initiatives which make a significant improvement
to LHCb software and are seen as having improved community participation in the software
design. Funding for one trip to a non-HEP conference/hackathon/whatever (per team member)
of the winner's choice. To be voted on by collaboration members.
